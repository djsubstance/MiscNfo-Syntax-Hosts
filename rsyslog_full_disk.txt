Handling Disk-Full Situations
  Add these lines to your rsyslog configuration file (/etc/rsyslog.conf 
  [or a specific file in /etc/rsyslog.d/)]

$WorkDirectory /var/spool/rsyslog  # make sure this directory exists
$ActionQueueFileName fwdRule1      # unique name prefix for spool files
$ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 1g        # 1GB space limit on disk usage
$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on      # save messages to disk on shutdown
$ActionResumeRetryCount -1         # infinite retries on resume

2. Using $ActionQueueDiskLowWaterMark
You can specify a low watermark for disk space at which rsyslog should try to resume logging to disk after it has stopped due to disk space constraints.
$ActionQueueDiskLowWaterMark 200m  # resume logging if disk space goes above 200MB

To specifically handle situations where the disk is full, you can use the directive $ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 
+ combine it with specific actions when the queue is full:

$template DynFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/syslog.log"
*.* ?DynFile
& stop  # stop processing further actions if disk is full

------- Log rotate -------
/etc/logrotate.conf

Add this:

/var/log/syslog {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 640 root adm
    missingok
}


Restart rsyslogd
