Filename: ExtensiveCookie_Tracker_list.txt
Desc: Nice list you can easily make regex's out of to drop in Burp or Zap (prior to making automated requests) which 
      will minimize your footprint

Valid Example:

Scrolling down the list you will see the following 5 entries:
"_opt_awcid","Analytics","Google Analytics, Optimize","24 hours","Set from partner domain"
"_opt_awmid","Analytics","Google Analytics, Optimize","24 hours","Set from partner domain"
"_opt_awgid","Analytics","Google Analytics, Optimize","24 hours","Set from partner domain"
"_opt_awkid","Analytics","Google Analytics, Optimize","24 hours","Set from partner domain"
"_opt_utmc","Analytics","Google Analytics, Optimize","24 hours","Set from partner domain"
 ^^^^^ - we have 5 chars that do not change, we can write one Burp Regex to drop them.

You want to match any cookie name that starts with _opt_. Here’s how you can construct such a regex:

Valid Regex to match the 5 above:      _opt_aw[cgkmu]id

Here’s how to apply it in Burp Suite for dropping requests: (burp)

[*] Open Burp Suite and go to the Proxy tab.
[*] Navigate to the Options sub-tab.
[*] In the Match and Replace section, add a new rule.
[*] For the type, choose Request header.
[*] In the match section, insert your regex: _opt_aw[cgkmu]id
[*]  can leave the replace section empty if you want to remove these cookies, or you can replace it with some specific value if needed.
[*] Now effectively identify and manipulate HTTP requests containing the specified cookies. Ensure that the regex pattern correctly matches the cookie names in actual HTTP requests, as the specific formatting and context might require adjustments to the regex.

Without further ado- here is the list so far - I know there are TONS more. Fork this and contribute if you can:
